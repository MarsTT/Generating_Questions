This is the original passage:
Wadleigh named interim CEO of Access Health CT
The Access Health CT Board of Directors unanimously appointed James R. Wadleigh Jr as interim CEO of Connecticut’s insurance exchange.

The news comes just one day after Access Health CT CEO Kevin Counihan announced he was recruited by the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell to help run healthcare.gov.

Wadleigh, chief information officer for Access Health CT, was one of three candidates the board considered during their closed-door deliberations Wednesday. The board also considered Access Health CT’s Chief Operations Officer Peter Van Loon and Chief Financial Officer Steven Sigal.

“Over the past two years, Jim has demonstrated great leadership in his role at Access Health, and we know he will continue to work collaboratively with the entire team,” Wyman said. “His strong background and experience will lead the Access Health team through the next open enrollment, as well as provide continuity on the overarching mission to provide residents of Connecticut with quality, affordable healthcare.”

Wadleigh, 47, has been working as chief information officer of the exchange since July 2012. Prior to that he served as senior director of application development of call center technologies at CIGNA.
